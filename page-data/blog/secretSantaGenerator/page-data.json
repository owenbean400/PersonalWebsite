It was a challenge to develop a good HTML email template because\neach email service provider and different medias (ex: computer and phones), I had to create something that worked for every email. So, I had a basic green background with rounded border that was good for white and black text. Therefore, when someone had dark mode, the text still showed on the green background. The layout was\noriginally done with HTML tables, however I scraped that because I only had one text even though I wanted to bedazzle the email.</p>\n<p>Overall, the program works smoothly with my family. Everyone got only one person giving them a present that wasn't from themselves.\nMy Christmas was very fun, as I got a lot of peanut butter and jelly for making tons of PB&#x26;J sandwich :)</p>\n<p>Link to my GitHub code if you would like to try out my <a href=\"https://github.com/owenbean400/secretSantaGenerator\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Secret Santa Generator</a>.
